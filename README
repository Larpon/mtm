The Media Tool Menu KDE5 service menu (MTM) is a bunch
of KDEÂ¤ service menus that integrates into konqueror, dolphin or any other software that utilitize KDE5 service menus.

The tool scripts can convert to and from various audio formats as well as dump audio from .flv videos
The service menus are using shell scripts and common audio and video commandline tools to do all the hard work.

The scripts can (hopefully) easily be extended to more conversions between formats.

In order to have the menus working correctly you should have this commandline software installed on your system:

As a minimum:
kdialog
ffmpeg
lame
oggenc

For extra convenience and slickness:
id3v2
vorbiscomment
metaflac
faad

Kubuntu 15.04:
If you don't have kdialog available try installing 'sudo apt-get install kde-baseapps-bin'

The tags currently preserved (from/to mp3/ogg/flac/aac) are as follows:
Title
Artist
Album
Date
Year
Comment
TrackNumber
Genre
Publisher
Language
Encoder

As of now MTM specializes in converting from:
wav
mp3
oggenc
flac
aac
amr
flv

to:
wav
mp3
ogg

The menu will be installed as:
<right click> -> Actions -> Convert
or
<right click> -> Actions -> Dump Audio
Depending on the file type

Enjoy!
