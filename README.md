# Description
The Media Tool Menu KDE4 service menu (MTM) is a bunch
of KDEÂ¤ service menus that integrates into konqueror, dolphin or any other software that utilitize KDE4 service menus.

The tool scripts can convert to and from various audio formats as well as dump audio from .flv videos
The service menus are using shell scripts and common audio and video commandline tools to do all the hard work.

The scripts can (hopefully) easily be extended to more conversions between formats.

# Requirements
In order to have the menus working correctly you should have this commandline software installed on your system:

## As a minimum:
* mplayer
* lame
* oggenc

## For extra convenience and slickness:
* id3v2
* vorbiscomment
* metaflac
* faad

## Tags
The tags currently preserved (from/to mp3/ogg/flac/aac) are as follows:
* Title
* Artist
* Album
* Date
* Year
* Comment
* TrackNumber
* Genre
* Publisher
* Language
* Encoder

# Formats
As of now MTM specializes in converting:
### from:
* wav
* mp3
* oggenc
* flac
* aac
* amr
* flv

### to:
* wav
* mp3
* ogg

# Integration
The menu will be installed as:
<right click> -> Actions -> Convert
or
<right click> -> Actions -> Dump Audio
Depending on the file type

Enjoy!
